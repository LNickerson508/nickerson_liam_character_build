        Commander of the Redguns, the Balam Group's AC squad.
        </p>

        <p class="lb_text">
        Michigan took up leadership after a career as the commander of the Furlong Armed Fleet. There, he earned a reputation as a merciless, heavy-handed ogre of a man, and he was equally feared by friend and foe alike, who knew him as "Hell on Four Legs."
        </p>

        <p class="lb_text">
        Apparently, he has posted a bounty on his own head to Balam's bounty boardâ€”with the stipulation that half of the reward money is to be distributed among his former comrades at Furlong.

        <p class="lb_text">
        Formerly the commander of the Balam Security Force, a paramilitary police organization that preceded the formation of the Redguns. Nile distinguished himself with an exceptionally high arrest rate, and in those days, the only man he never managed to put in handcuffs was Michigan, then the commander of the rival Furlong Armed Fleet.

        Having failed to arrest the man, he instead settled for a friendly drink with his old nemesis

        <p class="lb_text">
        A born con artist, no scheme was too underhanded for Wu Huahai during his days as a criminal mastermind, and exploitation of others was a byword for opportunity. However, his illicit Feng Shui Pharmacy operation was a fatal overstep, imperiling the health of Balam's economic sphere and leading to widespread disease.
        </p>

        <p class="lb_text">
        It was Nile, now the deputy commander of the Redguns, who ultimately shut Wu Huahai down.

        Gun Four of the Redguns, the Balam Group's AC squad.

        <p class="lb_text">
        After beating the rebellious Volta and Iguazu into submission, Michigan made it his personal crusade to make something of the two, and thus began their daily hell.
        </p>

        <p class="lb_text">
        For the past seven years, neither Volta nor Iguazu have achieved their goal: "to punch the living daylights out of Michigan, then get the hell out of the Redguns" (as they would put it). Volta has since admitted defeat, and is now learning about business from Wu Huahai.

        A backstreet gambler, Iguazu bet big and lost, and he was forced to undergo experimental 4th-generation augmentation surgery to pay back his debtors.
        </p>

        <p class="lb_text">
        In his new life, he quickly began to quarrel with Volta, his oftentimes partner in crime. Iguazu's recalcitrant nature was such that one day he even picked a fight with the Hero of Jupiter, who retaliated with such fury that Iguazu never quite looked the same afterward.

        As a young boy, Red's life was forever changed when he saw the news broadcasts of Commander Michigan's brutal triumphs in the Jupiter War.

        <p class="lb_text">
        Red trained through blood, sweat and tears in order to emulate his idol, supporting his impoverished siblings all the while. When the Balam admission examination finally came, he won his place in the Redguns at the very moment he stood at attention to greet the squad.
